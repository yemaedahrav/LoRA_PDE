# Weight Decomposition for PINNs

Exploring Matrix Decomposition to remove weight spaces fluctuations and dissimilarities in context of PDEs


## Experiment Setup and Structure

There are 100 boundary points along each side of the domain (each edge) of the rectangle. We have 2500 colocation points sampled using the latin hypercube sampling in the cartesian rectangular domain
